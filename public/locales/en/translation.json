      "section1Item2": "<strong>Ventilation:</strong> Good airflow is essential to remove moisture, ammonia, and pathogens. Ensure shelters have open ridges, side-wall openings, or fans, but avoid direct drafts on the animals.",
      "section1Item3": "<strong>Dry Bedding:</strong> A clean, dry resting area is non-negotiable. Use materials like straw, sand, or rubber mats. Wet bedding is a breeding ground for bacteria that can cause mastitis and foot rot.",
      "section1Item4": "<strong>Clean Water Access:</strong> Cattle require constant access to clean, fresh water. Water troughs should be cleaned daily to prevent algae and contamination.",

      "section1Item2": "<strong>Nutrition:</strong> Ensure the cow has access to high-quality feed and minerals, but avoid over-feeding, which can lead to oversized calves and difficult births.",
      "section1Item3": "<strong>Observation:</strong> Watch for signs of impending birth, such as a swelling udder, relaxed pelvic ligaments, and isolation from the herd.",
      "section2Title": "Post-Calving Care",
      "section2Item1": "<strong>Colostrum is Critical:</strong> The calf must receive colostrum (the first milk) within the first 2-4 hours of life. It contains essential antibodies. The calf should consume about 10% of its body weight in colostrum within 12 hours.",
      "section2Item2": "<strong>Navel Care:</strong> Disinfect the newborn calf's navel with an iodine solution to prevent infection.",

      "section1Item4": "<strong>Water:</strong> Clean, fresh water must be available at all times. A lactating cow can drink over 100 litres of water a day.",
      "section2Title": "Feeding Strategy",
      "section2Item1": "<strong>Feed according to production:</strong> A high-yielding cow requires more concentrate feed than a dry cow. A general rule is to provide 1 kg of concentrate for every 2.5 litres of milk produced, in addition to maintenance rations.",
      "section2Item2": "<strong>Provide Dry Matter:</strong> Ensure the animal gets enough dry fodder (straw) to meet its dry matter intake requirements, which is crucial for proper digestion.",
